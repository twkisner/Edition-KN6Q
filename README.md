# Edition-KN6Q

This is my fork of the [Edition](https://github.com/TryGhost/Edition) theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). 

I noticed it was close to the OG Casper theme from Ghost 1.0, so I modified it to not have the subscriber stuff and display the blog image instead.

# Development

I don't complie it using the gulp stuff like the official Edition theme.  The Screen.css loaded in Default, not a built version.
